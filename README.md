# Malaria Data Visulization 

Malaria is a disease that is transmitted from person to person by infected mosquitoes. In serious cases, it can result in coma and death. Although the annual malaria deaths is in hundreds of thousands, the estimates differ substantially globally. Using `Plotly`and `Altair` in Python, I made interactive data visualization to show the globally difference in malaria incidences and deaths.
