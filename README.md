# Malaria Data Visulization 

Malaria is a disease that is transmitted from person to person by infected mosquitoes. In serious cases, it can result in coma and death. Although the annual malaria deaths is in hundreds of thousands, the estimates differ substantially globally. Using `Plotly`and `Altair` in Python, I made interactive data visualization to show the globally difference in malaria incidences and deaths. 

The data sets used:

- [`malaria_inc.csv`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2018/2018-11-13/malaria_inc.csv) - Malaria incidence by country for all ages across the world across time.
- [`malaria_deaths.csv`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2018/2018-11-13/malaria_deaths.csv) - Malaria deaths by country for all ages across the world and time.
- [`malaria_deaths_age.csv`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2018/2018-11-13/malaria_deaths_age.csv) - Malaria deaths by age across the world and time.
